# final four basket ball picks prognosticator

this project is a self-contained web page that will generate a series of picks
for you for the NCAA basketball tournament. my idea is that you keep running it
until you come up with a set that you're happy with, but it can be used however
you want.


here are some enhancements i want to make:
- JSON object [via textarea]in addition to text input boxes for an atlernative
  way to enter teams
- generated bracket should show up above text entry boxes
- rework regions data structure to be a hash [keyed on region name] instead of
  an array
- add config switch for how many upsets to allow
