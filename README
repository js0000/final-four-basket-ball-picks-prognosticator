# final four basket ball picks prognosticator

this project is a self-contained web page that will generate a series of picks
for you for the NCAA basketball tournament. my idea is that you keep running it
until you come up with a set that you're happy with, but it can be used however
you want.

a new version featuring 
- json support
- better: colors, layout, docs

still needs better data validation.
